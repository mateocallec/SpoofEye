## Coding Standards

SpoofEye follows these guidelines to keep the code clean and maintainable:

* **Language:** C/C++ (adjust if using other languages)
* **Formatting:** Use consistent indentation and spacing.
* **Naming:** Use descriptive variable and function names.
* **Comments:** Use **Doxygen-style comments** for functions, classes, and major logic blocks.
* **Commit Messages:** Use imperative tense, e.g., `Add feature X` or `Fix bug in Y`.

**Example Doxygen Comment:**

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Calculates the checksum of a given buffer.
 * 
 * @param buffer Pointer to the data buffer.
 * @param length Length of the buffer in bytes.
 * @return uint32_t Calculated checksum.
 */
uint32_t calculateChecksum(const uint8_t* buffer, size_t length);
```

## Documentation

* Keep documentation updated along with code changes.
* Use Doxygen comments for all public functions, classes, and modules.
* Ensure README and any user-facing docs reflect your changes.
